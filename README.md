# Angled LEGO

When building with LEGOs, bricks are usually placed in parallel or in right angles to align with the studs. However, in some cases, it is possible to put a LEGO brick at a different angle. This have been used in official LEGO sets, for example in the [Corner Garage](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/corner-garage-10264?CMP=AFC-AffiliateUS-wd9glLyZH6Y-3813674-115554-3).

Mathematically, this boils down to computing (near) Pythagorean triples. Here, we also allow half-integers because there are LEGO pieces which allow putting a stud in the middle between two studs. For a more through discussion, see this [blog post](https://www.jonaslindstrom.dk/?p=1160).
